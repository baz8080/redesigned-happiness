An android app which removes junk metadata that HTC leaves in your contacts

I don't know if having loads of `<HTCData>...</HTCData>` in your contacts annoys you, but it annoys me. I wrote this app to remove it and to learn a bit more about Android's contacts API. I now have a qualified dislike for the contact APIs. Feel free to use this but be careful.
